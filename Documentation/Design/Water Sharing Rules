# Water Sharing Rules

## Document Information
- **Version**: 2.0
- **Last Updated**: December 2025
- **Status**: Draft
- **Owner**: Business Analyst / Solution Architect

## Overview

This document specifies the water sharing rules that govern how water is allocated to customers across Sunwater's 26 Water Supply Schemes. Water sharing rules determine the availability of water based on storage levels, priority levels, and scheme-specific calculations.

### Purpose

Water sharing rules serve to:
- Ensure equitable distribution of available water among customers
- Manage water scarcity during drought periods
- Provide predictable allocation mechanisms to support farming and business decisions
- Maintain compliance with Resource Operations Plans (ROPs) and Resource Operations Licences (ROLs)

### Rule Types

Sunwater operates three primary water sharing rule types:

1. **Announced Allocation** - Percentage-based allocation announced periodically based on storage levels
2. **Continuous Share** - Daily distribution based on proportional share of storage
3. **Continuous Accounting** - Reserve-based distribution as water becomes available

Each scheme operates under one water sharing rule type as specified in its Resource Operations Licence.

### Document Status

**Current Completeness**:
- ✅ **Announced Allocation**: Complete with 6 scheme examples covering all major variations
- ⚠️ **Continuous Share**: Business process documented, awaiting specific scheme Operations Manuals (e.g., Eton WSS)
- ⚠️ **Continuous Accounting**: Business process documented, specific scheme formulas to be added when Operations Manuals obtained

## 1. Announced Allocation

### 1.1 Purpose & Overview

**Purpose**: Announced Allocation (AA) is a water sharing rule that determines the percentage of a customer's water allocation entitlement that is available for use during the water year. The percentage is calculated periodically based on current storage levels and projected water availability.

**How It Works**:
- At the start of each water year, an initial Announced Allocation percentage is calculated
- The percentage applies to all customers within a priority group
- As storage levels change throughout the year, the percentage may be recalculated and increased
- **Critical Rule**: Announced Allocations cannot be reduced during a water year (except under extreme drought provisions)
- When AA reaches 100%, no further calculations are needed for that priority group

**Priority Groups**:
Most schemes with Announced Allocation have multiple priority groups:
- **High Priority (HP)** - Highest security, typically receives 100% allocation except in severe drought
- **Medium Priority (MP)** - Lower security, receives variable allocation (0-100%) based on storage
- **Medium A Priority (Medium A)** - Variant used in some schemes with different calculation rules

Some schemes have subdivided high priority groups (High A1, High A2) or sub-schemes (Upper/Lower, Burnett/Kolan) with different calculation rules.

**Schemes Using Announced Allocation**:
This document provides detailed formulas for six schemes representing all major variations:
1. **Nogoa Mackenzie WSS** - Standard AA with multiple storages, HP+MP, carryover
2. **Julius Dam WSS** - Simple AA with single storage, HP only
3. **Bowen Broken WSS** - Complex AA with multiple high priority groups (High A1, High A2), multiple storages
4. **Dawson Valley WSS** - AA with sub-schemes (Upper/Lower Dawson), Medium A priority group
5. **Bundaberg WSS** - AA with bulk capacity shares (Burnett/Kolan sub-schemes)
6. **Mareeba Dimbulah WSS** - Standard AA with critical water sharing provisions

Other schemes using Announced Allocation include: Emerald, Burdekin Haughton, Proserpine River, and others.

### 1.2 High-Level Business Logic

#### 1.2.1 Calculation Triggers

Announced Allocation calculations are triggered:

**Initial Calculation**:
- At the start of each water year
- Water year typically runs 1 July - 30 June (exceptions: Dawson Valley 1 Oct - 30 Sept, Eton 1 Apr - 31 Mar)
- Applied to all priority groups

**Recalculation During the Year**:
- **Monthly Check**: If AA < 100%, recalculate within 5 business days of the first day of each month
- **Quarterly Check** (Bundaberg): Within 5 business days of each quarter start
- **Major Inflow** (Bundaberg): Within 10 business days after major inflow event
- **Reset Trigger**: If recalculation shows:
  - Increase of ≥5 percentage points, OR
  - Increase to 100%
- **Stop Condition**: When AA reaches 100% for a priority group, no further calculations needed

**Publication Requirements**:
- Publish within 5 business days of calculation/reset (2 business days for Bundaberg recalculations)
- Publish on Sunwater website with parameters used
- Notify customers
- Report to DRDMW (Department of Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water)

#### 1.2.2 Calculation Sequence by Priority

The order of calculation depends on the scheme's priority structure:

**For Standard Schemes** (Nogoa Mackenzie, Julius Dam, Mareeba Dimbulah):
1. Calculate High Priority (HP) allocation percentage
2. Calculate Medium Priority (MP) allocation percentage
   - MP can only be >0% when HP = 100%

**For Multi-High Priority Schemes** (Bowen Broken):
1. Calculate High A1 priority allocation
2. Calculate High A2 priority allocation
3. Calculate Medium Priority allocation
   - MP can only be >0% when both High A1 and High A2 = 100%

**For Sub-Scheme Variants** (Dawson Valley):
- Upper Dawson: Medium A, then Medium priority groups (conditional relationship)
- Lower Dawson: Medium priority (HP at 100% when MP > 0%)

**For Bulk Capacity Share Schemes** (Bundaberg):
- Burnett sub-scheme: Burnett HP, then Burnett MP
- Kolan sub-scheme: Kolan HP, then Kolan MP

#### 1.2.3 Customer Allocation Calculation

Once the AA percentage is determined, individual customer allocations are calculated:

```
Customer Available Water = Customer Entitlement × AA%
```

**Example**:
- Customer entitlement: 1,000 ML
- High Priority AA: 100%
- Medium Priority AA: 91%

If customer has:
- 600 ML High Priority entitlement → 600 ML available (600 × 100%)
- 400 ML Medium Priority entitlement → 364 ML available (400 × 91%)
- **Total available**: 964 ML

#### 1.2.4 Key Business Rules

1. **Non-Reduction Rule**: AA% cannot decrease during a water year (with rare exceptions for extreme drought)
2. **Rounding**: AA% is rounded to the nearest whole percent (Bundaberg rounds up)
3. **Bounds**: AA% must be between 0% and 100%
4. **Priority Precedence**: High Priority must reach 100% before Medium Priority can be >0%
5. **Year-End Reset**: All allocations reset at the start of new water year
6. **Carryover**: Unused allocation may be carried forward (scheme-specific rules apply)

### 1.3 Detailed Calculations & Formulas

Announced Allocation formulas vary by scheme as specified in each scheme's Resource Operations Licence (ROL) and Operations Manual. This section provides detailed formulas for six representative schemes covering all major variations.

#### 1.3.1 Formula Components (Common Parameters)

Before diving into scheme-specific formulas, here are common parameters used across schemes:

**Storage Parameters**:
- **CV** = Current Volume (ML) - The actual volume currently in storage
- **EL** = Elevation (m AHD) - Water level height above Australian Height Datum
- **SA** = Surface Area (ha) - Current water surface area
- **SL** = Storage Loss (ML or mm) - Expected evaporation and seepage
- **DSV** = Dead Storage Volume (ML) - Volume that cannot be accessed
- **MOV** = Minimum Operating Volume (ML) - Volume below which normal operations cannot occur
- **NOV** = Nominal Operating Volume (ML) - Standard operating reserve
- **ASV** = Adjusted Storage Volume (ML) - Current volume adjusted for projected losses

**Useable Volume Calculation**:
```
UV = ASV - MOV  (or ASV - DSV depending on scheme)

Where:
ASV (Adjusted Storage Volume) = CV - Projected Storage Loss
Projected Storage Loss = Evaporation + Seepage through to end of water year
```

**Allocation Parameters**:
- **HPA** = High Priority Allocation (ML) - Total nominal volume of all HP allocations in scheme
- **MPA** = Medium Priority Allocation (ML) - Total nominal volume of all MP allocations in scheme
- **MAPA** = Medium A Priority Allocation (ML) - Total nominal volume of all Medium A allocations
- **HDIV** = High Priority Diversions (ML) - Total HP water taken this water year
- **MDIV** = Medium Priority Diversions (ML) - Total MP water taken this water year
- **DIV** = Total Diversions (ML) - All water taken this water year
- **CO** = Carryover (ML) - Water carried forward from previous year
- **CODIV** = Carryover Diversions (ML) - Carryover water used this year
- **VIWY** = Volume In Water Year / Net Carryover (ML) - Carryover available

**Other Parameters**:
- **TOA** / **TOL** = Transmission & Operational Allowance/Loss (ML) - Expected delivery losses
- **RE** = Reserve (ML) - Water set aside for future months/years
- **IN** / **INCSG** = Inflow allowance (ML) - Expected natural inflows / CSG water

#### 1.3.2 Scheme 1: Nogoa Mackenzie Water Supply Scheme

**Scheme Characteristics**:
- **Storages**: Fairbairn Dam (primary), Bedford Weir, Bingegang Weir, Tartrus Weir
- **Priority Groups**: High Priority, Medium Priority
- **Water Year**: 1 July - 30 June
- **Complexity**: High - Multiple storages, complex carryover rules
- **Operations Manual Reference**: Nogoa_Mackenzie_Scheme__Operations_Manual.pdf

**High Priority Announced Allocation Formula**:

```
AA_HP = MIN(100%, 100 × (UV + HDIV) / HPA)

Where:
UV = Total Useable Volume across all four storages
HDIV = High Priority Diversions to date in water year
HPA = Total High Priority Allocation nominal volume
```

**Medium Priority Announced Allocation Formula**:

```
IF AA_HP < 100% THEN
    AA_MP = 0%
ELSE
    AA_MP = MIN(100%, 100 × (UV - HPA - TOA - RE + HDIV + MDIV + CODIV) / MPA)
END IF

Where:
UV = Total Useable Volume across all storages
HPA = Total High Priority Allocation
TOA = Transmission & Operational Allowance (from lookup table by month)
RE = Reserve for future periods (from lookup table by month)
HDIV, MDIV, CODIV = Diversions to date
MPA = Total Medium Priority Allocation
```

**Worked Example** (as of 7 April 2025):

*Given Data*:
- UV (Total) = 317,327 ML
  - Fairbairn Dam = 289,124 ML
  - Bedford Weir = 13,610 ML
  - Bingegang Weir = 5,935 ML
  - Tartrus Weir = 8,658 ML
- HPA = 46,127 ML
- HDIV = 0 ML
- MDIV = 9,719 ML
- CODIV = 134,810 ML

*High Priority Calculation*:
```
AA_HP = 100 × (317,327 + 0) / 46,127
AA_HP = 100 × 6.88 = 688% → Capped at 100%
Result: AA_HP = 100%
```

*Medium Priority Calculation*:
```
# With TOA + RE calculated for April
AA_MP = 100 × (317,327 - 46,127 - TOA - RE + 0 + 9,719 + 134,810) / MPA
Actual Result: AA_MP = 91%
```

#### 1.3.3 Scheme 2: Julius Dam Water Supply Scheme

**Scheme Characteristics**:
- **Storage**: Julius Dam (single storage)
- **Priority Groups**: High Priority only (no Medium Priority)
- **Water Year**: 1 July - 30 June
- **Complexity**: Low - Simplest scheme configuration
- **Operations Manual Reference**: Julius_Dam_ROL.pdf

**High Priority Announced Allocation Formula**:

```
AA_HP = MIN(100%, 100 × (UVJ + HDIV) / HPA)

Where:
UVJ = Useable Volume of Julius Dam
HDIV = High Priority Diversions to date
HPA = Total High Priority Allocation
```

**Useable Volume Calculation**:
```
UVJ = ASV - NOV

Where:
ASV = CV - Projected Storage Loss
NOV = Nominal Operating Volume = 8,190 ML
```

**Worked Example** (as of 1 July 2025):

*Given Data*:
- CV (Current Volume) = 99,194 ML
- Storage Loss = 22,048 ML (projected to end of water year)
- NOV = 8,190 ML
- HPA = 48,850 ML
- HDIV = 0 ML (start of water year)

*Useable Volume*:
```
ASV = 99,194 - 22,048 = 77,146 ML
UVJ = 77,146 - 8,190 = 68,956 ML
```

*High Priority Calculation*:
```
AA_HP = 100 × (68,956 + 0) / 48,850
AA_HP = 100 × 1.41 = 141% → Capped at 100%
Result: AA_HP = 100%
```

#### 1.3.4 Scheme 3: Bowen Broken Water Supply Scheme

**Scheme Characteristics**:
- **Storages**: Eungella Dam, Bowen River Weir, Gattonvale Offstream Storage
- **Priority Groups**: High A1, High A2, Medium
- **Water Year**: 1 July - 30 June
- **Complexity**: Very High - Multiple storages, multiple high priority groups, storage-specific formulas
- **Operations Manual Reference**: BowenBrokenWSSOperationsManual_May_2017.pdf

**Parameter Definitions**:
- **HA1** = Total nominal volume of High A1 allocations
- **HA2** = Total nominal volume of High A2 allocations  
- **M** = Total nominal volume of Medium allocations
- **UV** = Total Useable Volume (Eungella + BRW + GOSS)
- **UV_EUNGELLA** = Useable Volume of Eungella Dam only
- **UV_BRW+GOSS** = Useable Volume of Bowen River Weir + Gattonvale Offstream Storage
- **TOAH** = Transmission & Operational Allowance for High Priority
- **TOA** = Transmission & Operational Allowance for all priorities
- **RE** = High Priority Reserve
- **RE_HA2** = High A2 Priority Reserve = 7,226 ML (volume in Eungella Dam below 539.5m AHD)

**Formula Table**:

| Formula | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Formula 1 | `100 × (UV_BRW+GOSS + DIV_HA1) / HA1` |
| Formula 2 | `100 × (UV_EUNGELLA + DIV_HA2) / HA2` |
| Formula 3 | `100 × (UV - TOAH + DIV_HA1 + DIV_HA2) / (HA1 + HA2)` |
| Formula 4 | `100 × (UV - (HA1 + HA2) - TOA - RE - RE_HA2 + DIV) / M` |

**High A1 Priority Calculation**:

*Standard Condition* (Eungella Dam > 539.5m AHD):
```
AA_HA1 = MIN(100%, MAX(Formula 1, Formula 3))
```

*Low Storage Condition* (Eungella Dam ≤ 539.5m AHD):
```
AA_HA1 = MIN(100%, Formula 1)
```

**High A2 Priority Calculation**:

```
IF Formula 2 ≤ Formula 1 THEN
    AA_HA2 = MIN(100%, Formula 2)
ELSE
    AA_HA2 = MIN(100%, Formula 3)
END IF
```

**Medium Priority Calculation**:

```
IF AA_HA1 < 100% OR AA_HA2 < 100% THEN
    AA_M = 0%
ELSE
    AA_M = MIN(100%, Formula 4)
END IF
```

**Interpretation**:
- Bowen Broken balances multiple storages serving different priority groups
- High A1 primarily served by Bowen River Weir + Gattonvale
- High A2 primarily served by Eungella Dam
- Formula 3 provides "combined" allocation when individual storage formulas conflict
- Special protection (RE_HA2) when Eungella Dam drops below critical level
- Medium can only receive water when both high priority groups at 100%

#### 1.3.5 Scheme 4: Dawson Valley Water Supply Scheme

**Scheme Characteristics**:
- **Storages**: 
  - Upper Dawson: Glebe Weir, Gyranda Weir, Theodore Weir, Moura Offstream Storage, Moura Weir
  - Lower Dawson: Neville Hewitt Weir
- **Priority Groups**: High, Medium, Medium A (Upper Dawson only)
- **Water Year**: 1 October - 30 September (different from most schemes!)
- **Complexity**: High - Sub-schemes with different formulas, CSG water integration
- **Operations Manual Reference**: Dawson_Valley_WSS_Ops_Manual_Amended_30_9_22.pdf

**Upper Dawson Sub-Scheme Formula**:

Combined formula for both Medium A and Medium priorities:
```
(AA_m × MPA) + (AA_ma × MAPA) = (UV + IN + INCSG - HPA - RE - TOL - UCSG + DIV - VIWY)

With constraints:
IF AA_ma < 20% THEN AA_m = 0%
IF AA_ma > 20% AND AA_ma < 100% THEN AA_m = AA_ma - 20%
IF AA_m ≥ 80% THEN AA_ma = 100%
```

**Lower Dawson Sub-Scheme Formula**:

```
AA_m = MIN(100%, 100 × (UV + IN - HPA - RE - TOL + DIV - VIWY) / MPA)

High Priority:
IF AA_m > 0% THEN AA_HP = 100%
IF AA_m = 0% THEN AA_HP = 100% (but restrictions may apply)
```

**Parameter Definitions**:
- **IN** = Inflow allowance for natural inflows (from table by month)
- **INCSG** = Projected inflow of treated CSG water available for supplemented take
- **UCSG** = Unsupplemented use of treated CSG water (not available for supplemented take)
- **VIWY** = Net carryover volume (sum of available carryover volumes)
- **TOL** = Transmission operating loss (calculated based on announced allocation)

**TOL Calculation**:

*Upper Dawson*:
```
TOL = TOL1 × (MPA + MAPA + HPA - DIV) / (MPA + MAPA + HPA)
Where TOL1 is from lookup table with linear interpolation
```

*Lower Dawson*:
```
TOL = TOL2 × (MPA + HPA - DIV) / (MPA + HPA)
Where TOL2 is from lookup table with linear interpolation
```

**Key Features**:
- Integrates treated coal seam gas (CSG) water into allocation calculations
- Different water year (Oct-Sept) to align with seasonal patterns
- Medium A priority acts as "first tier" medium with Medium as "second tier"
- Sub-schemes operate independently with separate calculations

#### 1.3.6 Scheme 5: Bundaberg Water Supply Scheme

**Scheme Characteristics**:
- **Storages**: 
  - Burnett sub-scheme: Paradise Dam, Ned Churchward Weir, Ben Anderson Barrage, Fred Haigh Dam (Burnett bulk capacity share)
  - Kolan sub-scheme: Bucca Weir, Kolan Barrage, Fred Haigh Dam (Kolan bulk capacity share)
- **Priority Groups**: High Priority, Medium Priority (separate for each sub-scheme)
- **Water Year**: 1 July - 30 June
- **Complexity**: Very High - Bulk capacity shares, sub-schemes, quarterly calculations
- **Operations Manual Reference**: bundabergwssoperationsmanualjuly2020.pdf

**Unique Feature - Bulk Capacity Shares**:

Fred Haigh Dam is divided into two bulk capacity shares:
- **Burnett bulk capacity share**: 15% of Fred Haigh Dam full supply volume
- **Kolan bulk capacity share**: 85% of Fred Haigh Dam full supply volume

Daily accounting tracks volume for each share separately, crediting inflows proportionally and debiting releases based on which sub-scheme is being served.

**Calculation Frequency**:
- **Initial**: Within 5 business days of water year start
- **Recalculation**: Within 5 business days of each quarter start, and within 10 business days of major inflow
- **Publication**: Within 5 business days (initial) or 2 business days (recalculation)

**Burnett Sub-Scheme Formulas**:

*Burnett High Priority*:
```
AA_HP_Burnett = MIN(100%, ROUND_UP(100 × (UV + DIV_H - HPTOL - VIWY) / (HPA - 17,151)))

Where:
UV = Total useable volume for Paradise Dam + Ned Churchward + Ben Anderson + Burnett bulk capacity share
HPA - 17,151 = Adjustment for Burnett-specific allocations
```

*Burnett Medium Priority*:
```
IF UV_total > 340,000 ML THEN
    AA_MP_Burnett = 100%
ELSE
    AA_MP_Burnett = MIN(100%, ROUND_UP(100 × (UV - (HPA - 17,151) - RE + DIV - TOL - VIWY) / (MPA - 83,360)))
END IF

Where:
UV_total = Total useable volume including all Burnett storages
MPA - 83,360 = Adjustment for Burnett-specific allocations
```

**Kolan Sub-Scheme Formulas**:

*Kolan High Priority*:
```
AA_HP_Kolan = MIN(100%, ROUND_UP(100 × (UV + DIV_H - HPTOL - VIWY) / HPA))

Where:
UV = Total useable volume for Bucca Weir + Kolan Barrage + Kolan bulk capacity share
```

*Kolan Medium Priority*:
```
AA_MP_Kolan = MIN(100%, ROUND_UP(100 × (UV - HPA - RE + DIV - TOL - VIWY) / MPA))
```

**Parameter Definitions**:
- **VIWY** = Net carryover (difference between water carried over TO current year vs brought forward FROM current year)
- **HPTOL** = High Priority transmission/operational losses (from table by month)
- **TOL** = All priority transmission/operational losses (linearly interpolated based on MP announced allocation)
- **RE** = Reserve for future water years (from table by month)
- **ROUND_UP** = Round up to nearest whole percent (different from most schemes which round to nearest)

**Special Rules**:
- If provisional AA > current AA, new AA takes effect immediately
- If provisional AA ≤ current AA, no change (non-reduction rule)
- Paradise Dam threshold (340,000 ML) triggers automatic 100% MP allocation for Burnett

---

#### 1.3.7 Scheme 6: Mareeba Dimbulah Water Supply Scheme

**Scheme Characteristics**:
- **Storage**: Tinaroo Falls Dam (primary), plus weirs
- **Priority Groups**: High Priority, Medium Priority
- **Water Year**: 1 July - 30 June  
- **Complexity**: Medium - Standard structure with critical water sharing provisions
- **Operations Manual Reference**: MareebadimbulahWSSOperationsManualJune2017.pdf

**High Priority Announced Allocation**:

```
IF Critical Water Supply Arrangements Approved THEN
    AA_HP = Per critical water supply arrangements
ELSE
    IF AA_MP > 0% THEN
        AA_HP = 100%
    ELSE
        AA_HP = Per standard formula
    END IF
END IF
```

**Medium Priority Announced Allocation**:

```
AA_MP = MIN(100%, ROUND(100 × (UV + IN - HPA - RE + DIV_HP + DIV_MP + CO) / MPA))

Where:
UV = Useable volume (Tinaroo Falls Dam + weirs - storage losses)
IN = Inflow allowance (from table by month)
RE = Reserve (if applicable)
CO = Carryover (set to zero when triggers occur)
```

**Carryover Triggers** (CO reset to zero when):
- More than 6 months into water year; OR
- Tinaroo Falls Dam spills; OR
- Water level in Tinaroo Falls Dam ≤ 667.0 m AHD

**Critical Water Sharing Arrangements**:

When Tinaroo Falls Dam levels are anticipated to fall below minimum operating levels within 12 months, critical water sharing arrangements may be activated. These arrangements:
- Must be developed with local government, stakeholders, and community participation
- Include triggers for commencement and cessation
- Include monitoring and reporting schedule
- Consider options for transferring water to essential services
- Require Chief Executive approval
- Override standard allocation formulas

**Key Features**:
- Standard announced allocation structure similar to Nogoa Mackenzie
- Explicit provisions for extreme drought (critical water sharing)
- Carryover degradation mechanisms (resets under specific conditions)
- Inflow allowances included in calculation (anticipating future inflows)

### 1.4 Scheme Variations Summary

| Scheme | Complexity | Key Distinguishing Features |
|--------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Nogoa Mackenzie** | High | Multiple storages, standard HP+MP, extensive carryover |
| **Julius Dam** | Low | Single storage, HP only, simplest formula |
| **Bowen Broken** | Very High | Multiple high priorities (A1, A2), storage-specific formulas, conditional logic |
| **Dawson Valley** | High | Sub-schemes, Medium A priority tier, CSG water integration, Oct-Sept water year |
| **Bundaberg** | Very High | Bulk capacity shares, sub-schemes, quarterly calculations, 340,000 ML threshold |
| **Mareeba Dimbulah** | Medium | Standard structure + critical water provisions, carryover degradation |

**Common Patterns**:
1. All schemes use UV (Useable Volume) as foundation
2. All apply priority precedence (HP before MP)
3. All include transmission/operational allowances (TOA/TOL)
4. All apply non-reduction rule
5. All round to nearest percent (except Bundaberg rounds up)

**Variation Patterns**:
1. **Storage Complexity**: Single (Julius) → Multiple with combined UV (Nogoa) → Multiple with separate calculations (Bowen, Bundaberg)
2. **Priority Structure**: HP only (Julius) → HP+MP (Standard) → HP+Medium A+MP (Dawson) → Multiple HP tiers (Bowen)
3. **Calculation Frequency**: Monthly (Standard) → Quarterly + major inflow (Bundaberg)
4. **Special Integrations**: None → Carryover → CSG water → Bulk capacity shares → Critical provisions

### 1.5 Implementation Considerations

*(Pseudocode and implementation sections remain as in v1.0 - see original document)*

## 2. Continuous Share

### 2.1 Purpose & Overview

**Purpose**: Continuous Share is a water sharing rule that manages individual customer water accounts in accordance with their usage patterns and the volume of water physically in storage. Each customer is allocated a proportional share of the available storage, and account balances are determined daily according to share size and reconciled monthly or as required.

**How It Works**:
- Each customer receives a fixed "share" of the storage based on their water allocation entitlement
- Daily processing calculates each customer's expected balance based on:
  - Current storage level
  - Customer's proportional share  
  - Daily evaporation and seepage losses
  - Releases and diversions
- Monthly (or ad-hoc) reconciliation adjusts customer balances to match actual storage

**Key Differences from Announced Allocation**:
- **Daily Processing**: Balances updated every day vs. periodic percentage announcements
- **Individual Balances**: Each customer has unique ML balance vs. scheme-wide percentage
- **Share-Based**: Fixed share proportion vs. variable allocation percentage
- **Debit/Credit**: Customers can be in debit (used more than share) vs. binary available/unavailable

**Schemes Using Continuous Share**:
- Eton Water Supply Scheme (operations manual required for detailed formulas)
- Other schemes (to be documented)

**Business Process Reference**: MS004 (Continuous Share Daily Processing), MS005 (Continuous Share Reconciliation) from CASPR documentation

---

### 2.2 High-Level Business Logic

#### 2.2.1 Share Allocation

At the start of the scheme or when customers join:
```
Customer Share Size = Customer Allocation Entitlement / Total Scheme Allocations

Example:
Customer has 1,000 ML entitlement
Total scheme allocations = 50,000 ML
Customer Share = 1,000 / 50,000 = 2% of storage
```

Share size remains fixed unless customer's allocation entitlement changes.

#### 2.2.2 Daily Processing

**Daily Calculation** (performed each day):

1. **Determine Storage Level**: Get end-of-day storage reading
2. **Calculate Expected Balance** for each customer:
   ```
   Expected Balance = Current Storage × Customer Share %
   ```
3. **Calculate Variance**:
   ```
   Variance = Expected Balance - Actual Account Balance
   ```
4. **Apply Losses**:
   ```
   Daily Loss = Actual Balance × Daily Loss Rate
   Loss Rate = (Evaporation + Seepage) / Storage Volume
   ```
5. **Debit Releases**: Deduct customer orders filled during the day
6. **Post Transactions**: Create daily adjustment and loss transactions
7. **Update Balances**: Post to customer water accounts

**Transaction Types**:
- **Daily Balance Adjustment**: Credits/debits to align with share of storage
- **Evaporation Loss**: Debit based on customer's balance proportion
- **Seepage Loss**: Debit based on customer's balance proportion  
- **Release/Diversion**: Debit when water delivered

#### 2.2.3 Monthly Reconciliation

**Reconciliation Process** (monthly or after significant events):

1. **Audit Storage Level**: Verify actual physical storage volume
2. **Sum Customer Balances**: Add all customer account balances
3. **Calculate Variance**:
   ```
   Total Variance = Actual Storage - Sum(All Customer Balances)
   ```
4. **Investigate**: If variance > threshold, investigate cause:
   - Unmetered diversions
   - Measurement errors
   - Unaccounted inflows/outflows
   - System losses beyond calculated rates
5. **Distribute Variance** proportionally:
   ```
   Customer Adjustment = Total Variance × (Customer Balance / Total All Balances)
   ```
6. **Post Reconciliation Transactions**: Adjust all customer accounts
7. **Generate Report**: Document reconciliation results and any issues

#### 2.2.4 Key Business Rules

1. **Share Size Fixed**: Customer's proportion of storage doesn't change (unless allocation changes)
2. **Daily Processing Required**: Must run every day to maintain accuracy
3. **Losses Proportional**: Each customer bears losses proportional to their balance
4. **Negative Balances Allowed**: Customers can go into debit (used more than share)
5. **Reconciliation Mandatory**: Monthly or more frequently to correct accumulated errors
6. **Priority in Releases**: When storage critically low, may prioritize HP customers

### 2.3 Calculation Examples

**Example Scheme**:
- Total Storage Capacity: 50,000 ML
- Current Storage: 35,000 ML
- Total Allocations: 40,000 ML
- Three customers:
  - Customer A: 10,000 ML allocation (25% share)
  - Customer B: 20,000 ML allocation (50% share)
  - Customer C: 10,000 ML allocation (25% share)

**Day 1 - Initial Balances**:
```
Customer A Expected: 35,000 × 25% = 8,750 ML
Customer B Expected: 35,000 × 50% = 17,500 ML
Customer C Expected: 35,000 × 25% = 8,750 ML
Total: 35,000 ML ✓
```

**Day 2 - After Evaporation (100 ML lost)**:
```
New Storage: 34,900 ML
Daily Loss Rate: 100 / 35,000 = 0.286%

Customer A: 8,750 - (8,750 × 0.286%) = 8,725 ML
Customer B: 17,500 - (17,500 × 0.286%) = 17,450 ML
Customer C: 8,750 - (8,750 × 0.286%) = 8,725 ML
Total: 34,900 ML ✓
```

**Day 3 - After Customer B Orders 500 ML**:
```
Storage released: 500 ML
New Storage: 34,400 ML

Customer A: 8,725 - loss = 8,700 ML
Customer B: 17,450 - 500 - loss = 16,925 ML
Customer C: 8,725 - loss = 8,700 ML
(losses calculated similar to Day 2)
```

**Month End - Reconciliation**:
```
Measured Storage: 34,250 ML (50 ML variance from calculated)
Sum Customer Balances: 34,300 ML
Variance: -50 ML

Distribute variance:
Customer A adjustment: -50 × (8,700/34,300) = -12.7 ML
Customer B adjustment: -50 × (16,925/34,300) = -24.7 ML  
Customer C adjustment: -50 × (8,700/34,300) = -12.7 ML
```

## 3. Continuous Accounting

### 3.1 Purpose & Overview

**Purpose**: Continuous Accounting is a water sharing rule that grants distribution of water reserves to medium priority customers as reserves become available. Distribution is based on customer priority rankings and storage limits, with water distributed as specific volumes (ML) rather than percentages.

**How It Works**:
- DRDMW (Department) determines when additional water reserves are available for distribution
- Sunwater calculates distribution amounts for each eligible customer based on:
  - Customer's medium priority allocation size
  - Customer's priority ranking within the medium priority group
  - Customer's current account balance and storage limit
  - Total available reserve to be distributed
- Water is distributed as specific ML volumes (not percentages)
- Higher-priority customers receive distribution first

**Key Differences from Announced Allocation**:
- **Reserve-Driven**: Triggered by DRDMW determination vs. automatic calculation based on storage
- **Volume Distribution**: Specific ML amounts allocated vs. percentage of entitlement
- **Priority Sequencing**: Sequential distribution by priority ranking vs. all customers in group receive same percentage
- **Frequency**: Monthly or following inflows vs. start of year + monthly updates
- **Cumulative**: Each distribution adds to customer balance vs. percentage applies to total entitlement

**Schemes Using Continuous Accounting**:
- Documented in CASPR as distinct water sharing rule
- Specific scheme examples to be added when Operations Manuals obtained

**Business Process Reference**: MS003 (Continuous Accounting Distribution) from CASPR documentation

---

### 3.2 High-Level Business Logic

#### 3.2.1 Reserve Determination

**Trigger**: DRDMW determines available reserves based on:
- Significant inflow events
- Storage level improvements
- Revised water availability assessments
- Scheduled distribution periods (e.g., monthly)

**Reserve Calculation**: DRDMW provides:
- Total volume available for distribution (ML)
- Priority groups eligible for distribution
- Any special conditions or restrictions

#### 3.2.2 Distribution Calculation

**Step 1 - Identify Eligible Customers**:
```
For each customer:
- Has Medium Priority allocation? → Include
- Has reached storage limit? → Exclude
- Current balance + entitlement < storage limit? → Include
```

**Step 2 - Sort by Priority**:
```
Sort customers by:
1. Priority ranking (highest first)
2. Allocation size (if rankings equal)
3. Customer ID (for tie-breaking)
```

**Step 3 - Sequential Distribution**:
```
Remaining Reserve = Total Reserve Available

For each customer in priority order:
    Distribution Amount = MIN(
        Remaining Reserve,
        Customer Storage Limit - Current Balance,
        Available Capacity Based on Allocation
    )
    
    Allocate Distribution Amount to Customer
    Remaining Reserve = Remaining Reserve - Distribution Amount
    
    IF Remaining Reserve = 0 THEN EXIT
END FOR
```

**Step 4 - Create Transactions**:
- Create distribution transaction for each customer receiving water
- Post to customer available water account
- Update scheme reserve balance  
- Generate customer notifications

#### 3.2.3 Storage Limits

Customers may have storage limits that restrict how much water can be in their account:
```
Storage Limit = f(Allocation Size, Infrastructure Capacity, Scheme Rules)

Example:
Customer with 5,000 ML MP allocation might have:
- Storage limit = 7,500 ML (150% of allocation)
- Cannot receive distribution if balance ≥ 7,500 ML
```

#### 3.2.4 Key Business Rules

1. **Reserve-Based**: Only distributes when DRDMW determines reserves available
2. **Priority Sequencing**: Higher priority customers receive water first
3. **Storage Limit Enforcement**: Cannot exceed customer storage limits
4. **Volume-Based**: Distributions in ML, not percentages
5. **Non-Reversible**: Distributions generally cannot be reversed (except errors)
6. **HP Priority**: High Priority always satisfied before MP distributions

### 3.3 Distribution Examples

**Example Scheme Setup**:
- Available Reserve: 10,000 ML (determined by DRDMW)
- Five Medium Priority Customers:

| Customer | Allocation | Priority | Current Balance | Storage Limit | Available Capacity |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|
| A | 5,000 ML | 1 | 3,000 ML | 7,500 ML | 4,500 ML |
| B | 3,000 ML | 2 | 2,500 ML | 4,500 ML | 2,000 ML |
| C | 2,000 ML | 3 | 1,800 ML | 3,000 ML | 1,200 ML |
| D | 4,000 ML | 4 | 500 ML | 6,000 ML | 5,500 ML |
| E | 1,000 ML | 5 | 800 ML | 1,500 ML | 700 ML |

**Distribution Process**:

```
Remaining Reserve: 10,000 ML

Customer A (Priority 1):
  Available Capacity: 4,500 ML
  Distribute: MIN(10,000, 4,500) = 4,500 ML
  Remaining: 10,000 - 4,500 = 5,500 ML
  Customer A New Balance: 3,000 + 4,500 = 7,500 ML

Customer B (Priority 2):
  Available Capacity: 2,000 ML
  Distribute: MIN(5,500, 2,000) = 2,000 ML
  Remaining: 5,500 - 2,000 = 3,500 ML
  Customer B New Balance: 2,500 + 2,000 = 4,500 ML

Customer C (Priority 3):
  Available Capacity: 1,200 ML
  Distribute: MIN(3,500, 1,200) = 1,200 ML
  Remaining: 3,500 - 1,200 = 2,300 ML
  Customer C New Balance: 1,800 + 1,200 = 3,000 ML

Customer D (Priority 4):
  Available Capacity: 5,500 ML
  Distribute: MIN(2,300, 5,500) = 2,300 ML
  Remaining: 2,300 - 2,300 = 0 ML
  Customer D New Balance: 500 + 2,300 = 2,800 ML

Customer E (Priority 5):
  Remaining Reserve: 0 ML
  Distribute: 0 ML
  Customer E New Balance: 800 ML (unchanged)
```

**Result**:
- Total Distributed: 10,000 ML
- Customers A-D received water
- Customer E (lowest priority) received nothing this distribution
- Customer E may receive water in next distribution if reserves available
