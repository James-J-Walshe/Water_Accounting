## Overview

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Water Accounting Solution documentation. Terms are sourced from the CASPR project documentation and extended for this solution.

---

## A

**Announced Allocation (AA)**  
A water sharing rule that calculates a water user's entitlement available to them in a given Water Year as a percentage of the water user's water allocation title. Announced allocations are typically updated periodically throughout the water year as storage levels change.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**  
A contract of service between two applications defining how they communicate with each other using requests and responses.

---

## C

**CASPr (Customer and Stakeholder Project)**  
The project established to replace the legacy billing and water accounting solution, Orion, comprising Salesforce (CRM), Gentrack (Meter-to-Cash), and Water Accounting platform.

**Carryover**  
Unused water allocation that eligible customers can transfer from the ending water year into the next water year, subject to scheme-specific rules and limitations.

**Continuous Accounting**  
A water sharing rule that grants distribution based on priority of a medium priority water allocation title, expressed as a volume in the customer water account after water is distributed as reserves become available.

**Continuous Share**  
A water sharing rule developed to manage individual customer water accounts in accordance with their usage patterns and the volume of water physically in storage, allocating each customer a share of the storage and determining account balances daily.

**COTS (Commercial-off-the-Shelf)**  
Prebuilt application adapted after-market to Sunwater's needs rather than a commissioned custom-made solution.

**CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**  
Processes and supporting systems in which a business administers its interactions with customers.

---

## D

**DRDMW (Department of Regional Development, Manufacturing and Water)**  
Queensland Government Department responsible for Queensland's water management laws and regulatory activities.

---

## H

**High Priority Allocation (HP/HPA)**  
Water allocation with the highest security of supply, typically receiving 100% announced allocation except in severe drought conditions.

---

## L

**Ledger**  
An accounting record that tracks water balances and transactions in a double-entry format, ensuring accurate accounting of water assets.

---

## M

**M2C (Meter-to-Cash)**  
The end-to-end process of turning a measurement of consumption of water into an invoice and the subsequent collection of payment.

**Medium Priority Allocation (MP/MPA)**  
Water allocation with lower security than High Priority, receiving variable announced allocation (0-100%) based on storage levels.

---

## O

**OOTB (Out-of-the-Box)**  
Reference to the immediate usability or functionality of a newly purchased product without customization.

**Orion**  
Sunwater's legacy water accounting and billing system, being replaced by the CASPr solution.

---

## R

**ROL (Resource Operations Licence)**  
Allows Sunwater to take or interfere with the flow of water to operate dams and weirs, use streams to distribute water, and sets out rules about environmental releases and monitoring/reporting obligations.

**RPA (Robotic Process Automation)**  
Software solution designed to mimic a human user's use of a software application, used to implement business process improvements without changing the underlying system.

---

## T

**Temporary Transfer (TT)**  
Transfer of available water from one customer to another for the remainder of the water year. The allocation title ownership does not change, so water returns to original owner in next water year.

---

## W

**Water Account**  
Accounting structure established to manage water services delivered to customers, tracking allocations, usage, and available balances.

**Water Allocation**  
Authority that entitles a Sunwater customer to a certain number of megalitres of water in a specific scheme's dams, weirs, or barrages.

**Water Sharing Rule**  
The calculation method for distributing available water based on a customer's water entitlement. Can be Announced Allocation, Continuous Accounting, or Continuous Share.

**Water Supply Scheme (WSS)**  
A unique system used to collect, move, store, and distribute water to customers, characterised by differing assets, customer profiles and water requirements.

**Water Year**  
The total period (12 months) the customer must use their water allocation before usage resets to zero. For most schemes runs 1 July to 30 June. Exceptions: Eton (1 April-31 March), Dawson (1 October-30 September).
